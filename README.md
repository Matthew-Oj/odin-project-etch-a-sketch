# Etch-A-Sketch 

This project is part of **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** curriculum — a hands-on exercise to practice **DOM manipulation** and **JavaScript fundamentals**.  

It’s a simple yet fun browser-based drawing app, something between a *sketchpad* and an *Etch-A-Sketch*. The goal is to build everything from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, while exploring how to dynamically create, style, and remove elements in the DOM.
